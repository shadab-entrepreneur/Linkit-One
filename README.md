# Linkit-One
Wearable device using LinkitOne

General description and responsibilities: Having always the issues against women safety, i came up with this idea and worked on it in Under25 hackathon.
It is connected to a GPS module and also a Wi-Fi Module. It is then hooked up to a 16*2 RGB LCD, I also included a Button and a piezo buzzer.

WEAR has two modes:
1. The Hardware Device Mode: In the Hardware Device Mode, the user can click on the button on WEAR, on doing so the caregivers get a SMS Alert with a link to track the user in Real-Time.
2. The Smartphone Mode: In the Smartphone Mode, the user can open the WEAR Android App and Click on the Alert Button. On doing so a Notification is sent to the Wear Hardware Device at the user's home so that the caregivers can get a buzzer notification with a Link to monitor the User in Real Time on their Computer.
